        - Redux must be imported  ( I.E. import { <whatYouNeed> } from 'redux';) From this example it will be imported via unpkg CDN (line 10)
    01) 
        - The Redux store is in charge for holding and managing the application state
        - Redux  provide the method createStore() to create a store. 
        - This method requires a reducer function as an argument. For now we will always return the same string. 
        - The method getState allows to retrieve the current state.
    02)
        - Any state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. 
        - Actions are javascript object which have to be created and require type property, which will be used by Reducer to understand how to update the store.
        - It is possible to also provide data to an action 
        - the method dispatch allows to inform redux which an action on the store must be taken care of. 
        - The method requires an action as a parameter.
    03)
        - Once an action has been dispatched, it's the reducer job to take care of the actual update of the state.
        - Reducer are function taking an action and a state as arguments and return a NEW state (state is read only)
        - Note: Redux does not enforce state immutability! (I.E. DO IT YOURSELF!)
    04)
        - The subribe method proveded by the Redux Store allows you to subscribe a listener function which is called whenever an action is dispatched against the store.
    05)
        - Multiple reducer can be combined as a single one using the Redux.combineReducers method.
        - The combineReducers method accept an object containing as many property as your reducers. each property as the related reducer function as a value.
        - The returned value of combineReducers can then be provided to the createStore method.
        - Multiple reducers are usefull when managing large applications to simplify their maintenance.
    06)
        - Action creator are simply function which return an action. 
        - It can also be useful to create constant for different action type
    07)
        - Asynchronous action can be managed thanks to Redux Thunk middleware.
        - Redux Thunk must be imported in your code. From this example it will be imported via unpkg CDN (line 11)
        - Redux Thunk middleware must be provided to Redux.applyMiddleware(), and the returned value can be assigned as a second parameter to the createStore method
        - To create an asynchronous action, you can provide 
    08)
        - State should never be changed. You can use Object.assign or spread operator for this purpose

        store.dispatch({ type: 'FOO'});
