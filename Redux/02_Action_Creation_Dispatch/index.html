        - Redux must be imported  ( I.E. import { <whatYouNeed> } from 'redux';) From this example it will be imported via unpkg CDN (line 10)
    01) 
        - The Redux store is in charge for holding and managing the application state
        - Redux  provide the method createStore() to create a store. 
        - This method requires a reducer function as an argument. For now we will always return the same string. 
        - The method getState allows to retrieve the current state.
    02)
        - Any state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. 
        - Actions are javascript object which have to be created and require type property, which will be used by Reducer to understand how to update the store.
        - It is possible to also provide data to an action 
        - the method dispatch allows to inform redux which an action on the store must be taken care of. 
        - The method requires an action as a parameter.
